<h1>Audio Quality Assessment with Transformer-Based Learning</h1>

<p>This GitHub project introduces a novel approach to audio quality assessment using transformer-based deep learning architecture. The proposed model leverages the power of transformers to process audio data, providing enhanced performance over traditional approaches. This README provides an overview of the architecture, model configuration, and the tools used for this project.</p>



<h2>Architecture Overview and Model Configuration</h2>

<p>The proposed model employs a transformer-based deep learning approach to assess audio quality. It takes hand-crafted features concatenated into a vector as input and is trained with corresponding ground-truth labels. The transformer architecture, comprising an Encoder-Decoder structure with Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and Feed-Forward layers, processes the data. We utilized four layers of the encoder, set the number of heads (h) in each MHA to four, and employed an Adam optimizer. The model outputs a single continuous value representing audio quality in the range of 1 to 5. These design choices optimize feature vectors while considering attention mechanisms for enhanced performance.</p>
