<h1>Audio Quality Assessment with Transformer-Based Learning</h1>

<p>This GitHub project introduces a novel approach to audio quality assessment using transformer-based deep learning architecture. The proposed model leverages the power of transformers to process audio data, providing enhanced performance over traditional approaches. This README provides an overview of the architecture, model configuration, and the tools used for this project.</p>

<h2 id="architecture-overview">Architecture Overview</h2>

<p>The proposed model employs a transformer-based deep learning approach to assess the quality of audio clips. The key components of the architecture are as follows:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Input Data</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li>The model takes as input a vector that consists of three concatenated hand-crafted features.</li>
            <li>Each input vector is associated with the corresponding ground-truth label for training.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Transformer-Based Deep Learning</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li>Transformer models are employed to process sequential input data, akin to recurrent neural networks (RNNs).</li>
            <li>Transformers utilize the "attention mechanism" to provide context to each part of the data, allowing for more parallelization and improved performance.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Encoder-Decoder Structure</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li>The transformer model primarily follows an Encoder-Decoder structure.</li>
            <li>The input sequence is embedded into an n-dimensional vector space.</li>
            <li>A positional encoder is applied to maintain the order or relative position of each sequence part.</li>
            <li>The encoder includes two main components: Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and Feed Forward layers.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Multi-Head Attention (MHA)</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li>MHA consists of scaled dot-product attention units.</li>
            <li>These units compute embeddings containing contextual information and weighted combinations of similar tokens.</li>
            <li>During training, weight matrices (key weights, value weights, and query weights) are learned to enable attention.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Feed-Forward Neural Network</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li>Output encodings from the MHA are processed by a feed-forward neural network.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Encoder Module</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li>Instead of using both the encoder and decoder, this project utilizes only the encoder module.</li>
            <li>The output of the encoder is directly fed to a fully connected layer.</li>
            <li>This approach optimizes the feature vector while considering attention.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="model-configuration">Model Configuration</h2>

<p>The model configuration includes the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Four layers of the encoder (Layer 1 to 4).</li>
    <li>Number of heads (h) in each MHA set to four.</li>
    <li>Number of neurons equal to 2048.</li>
    <li>Adam optimizer for training.</li>
    <li>Mean square error loss function.</li>
    <li>Initial learning rate equivalent to 3Ã—10<sup>-6</sup>.</li>
    <li>The model outputs a single value representing audio quality in the range of 1 to 5 (bad to excellent).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="training-and-evaluation">Training and Evaluation</h2>

<p>To ensure robust model performance, we followed these practices:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Implemented an 80/20 training/test split.</li>
    <li>Utilized k-fold cross-validation with k = 5.</li>
    <li>The architecture was coded in Python using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries.</li>
    <li>The project was developed on Google Colab with Nvidia GPU support.</li>
</ul>
